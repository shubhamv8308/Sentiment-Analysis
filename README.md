Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Dataset
Project Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. The goal is to classify reviews as either positive or negative based on the text content. We leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Word2Vec embeddings, and deep learning to build an accurate sentiment classification model.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Performed extensive data cleaning including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
Word2Vec Embeddings: Created custom embeddings to capture semantic relationships between words in the reviews.
Model Optimization: Used Keras Tuner to optimize the deep learning model for the best performance.
Sentiment Classification: Built a deep learning model to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras
Word2Vec
Keras Tuner
Dataset
The IMDB dataset consists of 50,000 highly polarized movie reviews.

Training Data: 25,000 movie reviews
Test Data: 25,000 movie reviews
Labels: Binary classification (positive/negative)


Results
The optimized deep learning model achieved a high accuracy on the test set, providing robust performance in classifying positive and negative sentiments in movie reviews.
